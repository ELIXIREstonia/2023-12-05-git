### This is project readme file

Hi this is really not my repo, but I'm looking forward to be working on this code.

Let's make this project fly!!!

#### TODO list

* The first thing to do when I start working with the project is `git pull`
* If there are, resolve all conflicts
* make my edits
* `git stage`
* `git commit`
* just in case `git pull` again
* If something has happened, resolve conflicts again (my need new commit)
* `git push`

## changed from dev branch

* change two
* etc..
